# Getting started with C++ ?

* These are the programmes which will help you to get started with C++

### Why you should consider these ?

* So, you don't know where to start from & you just want to try it.

* Then, these programme may be helpful to you these `consist` of some explanation which gonna help you and I also explained (commented-out) the thing like why I `used something` and what is their `functioning`. 

* The best part is that these series or repo will gonna be updated frequently so you get to know something `new` whenever you visit this repo/folder.

* I also uploaded some medium level program mean that some program or thing might be confusing to you right now but when you do then consistently and going to practice by making different programs then they will be really easy to understand (but I also tried my best to explain what something does when I thought it might be confusing or new to someone).

### What if you find some other ways to do the same thing ?

* Then please consider to send a pull request to this repo section with the explanation why you think its better or easier to do or just send pull request so I can add it because their no harm in learning new ways to do a thing. 

* Then, I am gonna check it and if I think your way is better then I will definately update the files because we are here to improve and `Help eachother`. 

* If for some reason I didn't check it or reply you then you can `directly message` me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pranavgoel_29).
